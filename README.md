# MonteCarloHiggsGenerator

This project will use Monte Carlo integration to study Higgs boson production and decay at the LHC. We will generate simulated Higgs events by sampling parton distribution functions (PDFs) for 13 TeV proton–proton collisions and modeling Higgs production primarily through gluon–gluon fusion. Subsequent Higgs decays will be sampled according to their Standard Model branching ratios. The simulation will be used to estimate cross-sections, explore multi-dimensional probability distributions, and compare results with established LHC measurements. Techniques such as importance sampling and variance-reduction methods will be tested to improve numerical efficiency and accuracy. This framework will evaluate how Monte Carlo–based modeling reproduces key experimental observables.
